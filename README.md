# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This is an easy to use Day Planner that allows you to type and save text in the time blocks.
This project helped me learn jQuery and bootstrap. It also helped further my knowlege of javaScript.

## Usage

Day planner will color code the time blocks based on the time left in the day.

Grey = past hour,
Red = current hour,
Green = future hour,

You can type what you want to do in the time block and save it. Saved text will persist through sessions.

## Credits

Thanks to my study partner Jared for working on this with me.
